Pydoku 


This is a 24 hour coding project where I try to implement sudoku in python. 

The key takeaways that I wanted from this project was:
    Learning about Pygame and understanding its references to SDL
    Learning about how to implement 'history' features such as undo and redo
    Learning about how to implement backtracking for automatically solving the puzzle.
